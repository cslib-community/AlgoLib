# Trees

A *tree* is a connected forest: an acyclic simple graph in which every pair
of vertices is joined by a (necessarily unique) walk.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.IsTree G` — `G` is a connected forest.

## Implementation notes

Connectedness itself is not defined here. `SimpleGraph.IsConnected` lives in
`AlgoLib.Theory.Connectivity.Reachable`, where it is built on
`SimpleGraph.Reachable` and comes with the full component API. This file previously
carried a second, standalone definition of `IsConnected` phrased over the now-retired
`SimpleGraph.Contains`; it has been removed in favour of the canonical one, so that
there is a single notion of connectedness in the library.
