# Neighbourhoods and degrees

This file equips each of the four graph structures from
`AlgoLib.Graph.Basic` (`Graph`, `SimpleGraph`, `DiGraph`,
`SimpleDiGraph`) with neighbour sets, incidence sets, a degree function,
and the minimum and maximum degree.

## Main definitions

* `Graph.neighborSet`, `SimpleGraph.neighborSet` — the set of vertices
  adjacent to `v`.
* `DiGraph.outNeighborSet`, `DiGraph.inNeighborSet`,
  `SimpleDiGraph.outNeighborSet`, `SimpleDiGraph.inNeighborSet` — out-
  and in-neighbour sets.
* `Graph.incidenceSet`, `SimpleGraph.incidenceSet`,
  `DiGraph.outIncidenceSet`, `DiGraph.inIncidenceSet`,
  `SimpleDiGraph.outIncidenceSet`, `SimpleDiGraph.inIncidenceSet` —
  edges incident to (resp. leaving / entering) a vertex.
* `Graph.degree`, `SimpleGraph.degree`, `DiGraph.outDegree`,
  `DiGraph.inDegree`, `SimpleDiGraph.outDegree`,
  `SimpleDiGraph.inDegree` — the size of the relevant set, taken as a
  natural number via `Set.ncard`.
* `Graph.maxDegree`, `Graph.minDegree`, and analogues — the supremum
  / infimum of the degrees over `V(G)`, valued in `ℕ∞`.

## Design choices

* **Degree counts incident edges, not neighbours.** For the labelled
  multigraph types (`Graph`, `DiGraph`), `degree` is the cardinality
  of the incidence set, so parallel edges contribute their multiplicity.
  For the simple types, neighbour count and incidence count agree, and
  we define `degree` directly from `neighborSet` for brevity.
* **Loops are not neighbours.** For `Graph`, `neighborSet G v` excludes
  `v` itself. For simple graphs this is automatic by looplessness.
* **`Set.ncard` for total counting.** Degrees land in `ℕ`, returning
  `0` when the relevant set is infinite. Downstream finiteness
  hypotheses are needed to read this as a true cardinality.
* **`ℕ∞`-valued extremal degrees.** `minDegree` and `maxDegree` return
  values in `ℕ∞`, so the empty graph gives `maxDegree = 0` and
  `minDegree = ⊤` without per-definition finiteness hypotheses.

share an edge with `v`. A loop at `v` does not make `v` its own
neighbour. -/
