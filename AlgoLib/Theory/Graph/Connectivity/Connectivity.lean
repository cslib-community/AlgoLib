# Vertex and edge connectivity

The connectivity numbers `κ(G)` and `κ'(G)` measure how many vertices, respectively
edges, must be removed to destroy the connectivity of `G`.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.IsVertexSeparating G S` — deleting `S` disconnects `G` *or* leaves at most
  one vertex.
* `SimpleGraph.IsEdgeSeparating G F` — deleting `F` disconnects `G`, or `G` is trivial.
* `SimpleGraph.vertexConnectivity G` — the least size of such an `S`, written `κ(G)`.
* `SimpleGraph.edgeConnectivity G` — the least size of such an `F`, written `κ'(G)`.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.vertexConnectivity_ge_iff` / `SimpleGraph.edgeConnectivity_ge_iff` — the
  lower-bound characterizations; nearly everything else is a corollary.
* `SimpleGraph.vertexConnectivity_le_encard` / `SimpleGraph.edgeConnectivity_le_encard` —
  every separating set bounds the connectivity number from above.
* `SimpleGraph.vertexConnectivity_exists` / `SimpleGraph.edgeConnectivity_exists` — the
  infimum is attained, unconditionally; `SimpleGraph.vertexCutNumber_exists` and
  `SimpleGraph.edgeCutNumber_exists` are the conditional analogues for the cut numbers.

## Design choices

* **The Diestel convention.** `κ` is the least size of a vertex set whose deletion
  disconnects `G` *or leaves at most one vertex*. Without the second disjunct the
  complete graph `Kₙ` would have `κ(Kₙ) = ⊤`, since no vertex set disconnects it; with
  it, `κ(Kₙ) = n - 1`, and Whitney's inequality `κ ≤ κ' ≤ δ` holds without a case split.
  The same patch on the edge side gives the usual convention `κ'(G) = 0` for a graph with
  at most one vertex. The unpatched "least vertex cut" quantity is kept as
  `vertexCutNumber` / `edgeCutNumber` for comparison, with the degeneracy documented.
* **`Set.encard`, not `Set.ncard`.** `encard` is already `ℕ∞`-valued, so it needs no
  coercion inside the `⨅`, and it returns `⊤` rather than the junk value `0` on infinite
  sets. A `κ` built on `ncard` would report `0` — perfect disconnection — for a graph
  whose only cuts are infinite.
* **Nested `⨅`, mirroring `girth`.** The shape `⨅ (x) (_ : P x), f x` is the one used by
  `SimpleGraph.girth` in `AlgoLib.Theory.Structures.SimpleGraph_only.Girth`, so the
  same infimum API (`le_iInf₂_iff`, `iInf₂_le`, `iInf_eq_top`) applies verbatim. The
  empty-index convention makes the connectivity of a graph with no separating set `⊤`
  automatically.

/-! ## Separating sets -/

/-- `S` is *vertex-separating* in `G` when deleting it either disconnects `G` or leaves
at most one vertex.

The second disjunct is the Diestel convention. It is what makes `κ(Kₙ) = n - 1` rather
than `⊤`: no set of vertices disconnects a complete graph, but deleting all but one of
them leaves a single vertex. -/
def IsVertexSeparating (G : SimpleGraph α) (S : Set α) : Prop :=
  S ⊆ V(G) ∧ (¬ (G.deleteVertices S).IsPreconnected ∨ (V(G) \ S).Subsingleton)

/-- `F` is *edge-separating* in `G` when deleting it disconnects `G`, or `G` has at most
one vertex. The second disjunct gives the usual convention `κ'(G) = 0` on the trivial
graph, where no set of edges can disconnect anything. -/
def IsEdgeSeparating (G : SimpleGraph α) (F : Set (Sym2 α)) : Prop :=
  F ⊆ E(G) ∧ (¬ (G.deleteEdges F).IsPreconnected ∨ V(G).Subsingleton)

/-! ## The connectivity numbers -/

/-- The *vertex connectivity* `κ(G)`: the least number of vertices whose deletion either
disconnects `G` or leaves at most one vertex.

It is `⊤` exactly when no set of vertices does either — for instance in an infinite
complete graph. See `IsVertexSeparating` for the convention on complete graphs.
The computable counterpart `computeVertexConnectivity` is available in `./Computable.lean`. -/
noncomputable def vertexConnectivity (G : SimpleGraph α) : ℕ∞ :=
  ⨅ (S : Set α) (_ : G.IsVertexSeparating S), S.encard

/-- The *edge connectivity* `κ'(G)`: the least number of edges whose deletion
disconnects `G`, with the convention `κ'(G) = 0` when `G` has at most one vertex.
The computable counterpart `computeEdgeConnectivity` is available in `./Computable.lean`. -/

end SimpleGraph

/-- `κ(G)` is the vertex connectivity of `G`.

Declared directly inside `namespace AlgoLib` rather than inside `namespace SimpleGraph`,

into scope alongside `V(G)` and `E(G)`. -/

/-! ## Extremal separating sets, and attainment

The `⨅` defining `κ` ranges over a family that is never empty — deleting *all* the
vertices leaves nothing, which is a subsingleton — and an `ℕ∞`-valued infimum is always
attained, `ℕ∞` being well-ordered. So `κ(G)` and `κ'(G)` are realized by an actual
separating set, with no finiteness hypothesis anywhere: for an infinite complete graph
the minimizer is `V(G)` itself and both sides are `⊤`.

The unpatched cut numbers below do *not* enjoy this, which is the sharpest statement of
what the Diestel convention buys. -/

/-! ## The unpatched cut numbers

These are the literal readings of "the least size of a cut". They are recorded for
comparison and are *degenerate on complete graphs*: `Kₙ` has no vertex cut at all, so
`vertexCutNumber Kₙ = ⊤`. Prefer `vertexConnectivity` / `edgeConnectivity`. -/

/-- The least size of a vertex cut of `G`, the literal reading of Definition 3.1.(i).

whereas `κ(Kₙ) = n - 1`.

so the infimum ranges over a larger family. Equality holds whenever `G` has a cut at all
that is no bigger than the best subsingleton-leaving set — in particular for every
non-complete graph. -/

/-! ### Attainment, conditionally

Unlike `κ` and `κ'`, the cut numbers range over a family that can be empty — `Kₙ` has no
vertex cut — so attainment needs the existence of a cut as a hypothesis. Note that the
weaker-looking `≠ ⊤` is *not* the right hypothesis: it implies the existence of a cut
(see `exists_isVertexCut_of_vertexCutNumber_ne_top`) but is strictly stronger, since a
graph all of whose cuts are infinite has a cut and cut number `⊤`. -/
